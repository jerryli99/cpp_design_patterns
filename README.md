# C++ and Design Patterns

I learned OOP design patterns from this website ```https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern```

## What is a design pattern?

Uhm. I think the first thing that comes into my mind is asking what is a pattern?

So, let's say I have balls with only even numbers of red and even numbers of blue colors of them in a box. I want to visualize them in (pairs) blue-red. 

I am implying my problem: I cannot visualize the balls in the box confortably without them being organized.
 
I took the balls out of the box and put them on the table. I have:

1st pair blue-red => 2nd pair blue-red => 3rd pair blue-red ...

So the pattern is N*(balltype1-balltype2) on my table, where N is the number of pairs.

Uhm, OK. What is my point? 

Well, I designed a way to arrange the balls so that I can have a better view of them instead of having blue-red-blue-blue-red... In other words, I made a pattern that can solve my issue (making the balls look satifying...).

Now, I decided to record this pattern. After this, I put all the balls back to the box and leave. Next time, if I want to do this again in my friend's house who also has a box of balls but with green and orange, then I can just simply take out the recorded pattern and do the same thing.

Overall, I think design pattern is a blue print to solve a repeating problem based on people's needs. <br><br>


## What does the pattern consist of in the programmer's perspctive?
<strong>Intent</strong> of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.

<strong>Motivation</strong> further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.

<strong>Structure</strong> of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.

<strong>Code example</strong> in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
